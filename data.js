      description: "Heartbreaker is the debut studio album by Ryan Adams, released on September 5, 2000. The album was recorded over fourteen days at Woodland Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. It was nominated for the 2001 Shortlist Music Prize. The album is said to be inspired by Adams' break-up with music industry publicist Amy Lombardi. According to Adams, the album's title originates from a poster of Mariah Carey: \"My manager called and said, 'You have 15 seconds to name this record, ' My eyes focused on this poster of Mariah wearing a T-shirt that said HEARTBREAKER. I just shouted, 'Heartbreaker!’\"'",

Once you've had that epiphany, you can't really turn around and pretend that you haven't. It's about accountability.\" The album was placed at #14 on Rolling Stone's 50 Best Albums of 2008 list.

It’s the most New York California album I could cut loose from my musical soul, and for me as both a guitar player and songwriter, this is the zenith point dream time. While I won’t be able to match this album for its depth and broad color forms in the future, this is the sound of my soul and a door to a place I’ll be returning to again. The treasures in our past are the shamanic visions of the future when the destination is dream zone 3000. This is that. I’m only dreaming in Big Colors now. - RA 2021",
