He has produced albums for esteemed musicians including Willie Nelson, Jesse Malin, Jenny Lewis and has collaborated with some of music’s most influential artists such as Weezer, Fall Out Boy, America and many more. Ryan’s profound contributions to music have taken many different forms. From his songwriting, to his producing, to fronting the rock/alternative country band Whiskeytown, and forming, “Ryan Adams & The Cardinals,” his ability to connect with audiences across a variety of different mediums is undeniable. Adams’ musical creativity was recognized early on and led to his NME Best Solo Artist win in both 2003 and 2004. In addition to his self-titled, double-Grammy-nominated 2014 album, Ryan’s catalogue includes Heartbreaker, Ashes & Fire, Easy Tiger, Cold Roses, Jacksonville City Nights, Love Is Hell, his 2001 major label debut Gold, and more. Ryan’s artistry is not limited to his songwriting capabilities. In 2009, he published Infinity Blues, a book of free verse poetry about his journey to self-realization, and Hello Sunshine, a collection of poems and short stories. Ryan’s passion for writing continues, and he is currently working on his first novel. His music has spanned multiple musical genres, and has been incorporated in film and television specials such as Judd Apatow’s top grossing production Bridesmaids, This is 40, popular HBO TV series’ True Blood and Felicity, and his song, ‘Stay Alive’ appeared in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, starring Ben Stiller. In November 2014, Ryan performed a two-night engagement at New York’s famed Carnegie Hall, which turned into a critically acclaimed live album on PAX-AM records, a label specifically for his music releases. Ryan is widely known for his powerful shows performed all over the world and regarded for his prolific songwriting. He has been praised by many music icons including Noel Gallagher, Taylor Swift and the legend Elton John, who described him as the “fabulous one.” Adams currently resides in Los Angeles, California with his five cats, typewriter, and coffee machine.",

      description: "Heartbreaker is the debut studio album by Ryan Adams, released on September 5, 2000. The album was recorded over fourteen days at Woodland Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. It was nominated for the 2001 Shortlist Music Prize. The album is said to be inspired by Adams' break-up with music industry publicist Amy Lombardi. According to Adams, the album's title originates from a poster of Mariah Carey: \"My manager called and said, 'You have 15 seconds to name this record, ' My eyes focused on this poster of Mariah wearing a T-shirt that said HEARTBREAKER. I just shouted, 'Heartbreaker!’\"'",

Although the album is attributed solely to Adams, Easy Tiger features The Cardinals as his backing band, with Adams stating: \"The only real concept of this record was complete and utter collaboration.\" Adams states that the album contains \"very, very simple, very easy songs that, in my opinion, were written on the periphery of some more complex work.\" Easy Tiger marks the first appearance of both guitarist Neal Casal and bassist Chris Feinstein, following the departures of J.P. Bowersock and Catherine Popper, respectively.",

The album marks his final recording session with The Cardinals. According to Adams, the album \"is about the moment when you recognize the difference between ego and pride and your sense of service to your friends, family or yourself. Once you've had that epiphany, you can't really turn around and pretend that you haven't. It's about accountability.\" The album was placed at #14 on Rolling Stone's 50 Best Albums of 2008 list. The magazine also placed \"Magick\" at #13 on their 100 Best Singles of 2008 list. The album has sold over 250,000 copies worldwide.",

It’s a cliché inside a watercolor painting of neon blue smoke rising up off summer streets in the night. It’s the most New York California album I could cut loose from my musical soul, and for me as both a guitar player and songwriter, this is the zenith point dream time. While I won’t be able to match this album for its depth and broad color forms in the future, this is the sound of my soul and a door to a place I’ll be returning to again. The treasures in our past are the shamanic visions of the future when the destination is dream zone 3000. This is that. I’m only dreaming in Big Colors now. - RA 2021",
